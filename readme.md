# My Planck Layout

Basically I've configured the layout in a way that basically works for me. I have a 4x12 rev6_drop layout.

Description of the layers:
0. default layer, no real configuration outside of the modifier layers. escape is to the right of the spacebars.
1. numpad, same num row but under 789 is 4561230 as per regular numpads. have some weirder chars mapped in this layer too - things like tilde / backtick / pipe
2. function layer, this allows access to f1-12, delete, page up page down, hjkl, some other chars that i use a tonne (=-?`]) 
3.  vim layer, this tries to implement vim, kinda dicey implementation right now, need to toggle mac mode and sort out various windows bugs but it's ok for the basics
4. mouse layer, this has mouse movement(wasd), page up/down, hjkl, some media controls
5. VIM helper layer, lets you do things like delete  10 words etc.
6. CS layer, this lets me play cs with szxc instead of wasd. everythning is basically shifted down 1 vs the regular config.
7. admin layer, so far i've only implemented reset but i'll add a mac toggle eventually..
